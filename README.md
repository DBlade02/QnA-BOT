# QnA BOT

The aim of this project is to create a conversational chat bot using Machine Learning that can read books and answer the questions based on the prompted questions.

### Modules 
- Data Reader -> This module will be used for reading the books from the pdf files and extract the textual data to create the knowledge base.
- Transformer -> Initially we will be using the Hugging Face Pre-Built Transformer to create the Base Model.

TODO:
- Create Question Answer Sets Automatically? Chat Bot?? Latent Semantic Analysis?
- Create a custom transformer from scratch ??
- [Feature] Speech Recognition - Question Input from Human Voice like Amazon Alexa/Google Assistant.
- [Feature] Text-to-Speech Engine - Say out loud the results generated by the Model.
